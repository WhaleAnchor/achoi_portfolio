In this redesign project, on top of fixing the obvious issues (readability, repeats, clarity), I wanted to research the pain points of both of the servers and the customers. Here are my findings.

### Problems and Painpoints with the Menu
* Lack of spacing and tabs that makes it hard to easily identify each item (ie: Dishes and their Description)
* The "R" and "D" icons (Regular and Deluxe) were implemented as a way to indicate portion sizes for Lunch and Dinner. However, because of its specific wording, customers almost never bought the Deluxe size.
* Not only are there two sizes for many dishes, the "Regular" price is the same price as the same dish listed in the Lunch Specials. In other words, there were multiple listings of the same items leading to customer confusion and frustration AS WELL AS server frustrations in having to explain multiple times a day.
* The pictures used in this menu have no descriptions and some of the pictures are dishes that are not listed in the menu.
* Taking a quick look at "Entrees" in page 2, There are three items with different choices for protein, Teriyaki, Katsu, and Katsu Don. It's just... terrible.

### My Design Choices
* I made clear headers and containers for each section. 
* While I couldn't convince the owner to take off certain items (In fact, he wanted to add more), I my best to make the text large enough so even the elderly could read it.
* I grouped some items together in a way that made more sense such as items with protein choices. 
* I highlighted the Saica Bento, the restaurant's special dish that has the highest profit margins. The portion size is so large that customers are constantly "Wow!"-ing. 
* I removed "R" and "D" and separateed all Lunch price items to the Lunch Special. 
* I took new pictures, edited them, and labeled them. 
* There are some things I left in there as requested by the owner, but overall, I am satisfied.
* Today, revenue has gone up around 18% in person and 30% online since implementing the new menu and lunch special time restrictions.


## Project 2: Dinner Combos

There used to be an old Dinner Combo menu. While I do not have the files for the old menu, it followed the same design princples as the Old Menu. It was hard to read and used pictures that weren't on the Dinner Combo menu.

This is the New Dinner Combo Menu!

### My Design Choices
* I used the same font and design principles as the New Menu.
* I used the reddish orange text color because it is both the color of the restaurant's interior and the owners favorite color.


## Project 3: Online Ordering Website
At the time, the website was broken and would often bug out in the checkout page. I was asked to use the existing website so I fixed some issues and removed old and updated new items. Finally, I added some themes and new navbar sites.
